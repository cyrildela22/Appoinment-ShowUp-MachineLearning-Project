# Appoinment-ShowUp-MachineLearning-Project

## Project Details /Overview
This project primarily focuses on conducting data analysis and using machine learning models such as K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Logistics Regression, Random Forest and AdaBoost to predict whether a patient will show up for appointment.
The objective of this project is to visually and programmatically assess the Appointment Show up in Brazil dataset
and brainstorming what questions could be answered using the dataset and then build a classifier to predict show up. 
Pandas and NumPy would be used to answer the questions that I find to most interesting, and create a report sharing the answer.
